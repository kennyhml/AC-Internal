# AC-Internal
An internal cheat for [Assault Cube v1.2.0.2.](https://assault.cubers.net/) written purely in C++ with help from [Guided Hacking](https://guidedhacking.com/).

The cooler brother of [AC-External](https://github.com/kennyhml/AC-External).
### Tools used to reserve the game:
- [Cheat Engine](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine)
- [ReClassNET](https://github.com/ReClassNET/ReClass.NET)
- [IDA 8.3](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/)

### Current Features:
- ESP (armor, health, name, distance, weapon, ammo, team)
- Aimbot (much faster than the external variant)
- Wallhack (disable depth test to trick the game into thinking you can hit the target, credit to some guy on GH)
- Show enemy positions on the minimap and overlay map (credit to myself)
- Weapon and hit location spoofing to get 'headshot' multiplier (credit to some guy on GH & myself)
- Godmode (better than external variant because it doesnt just freeze the value)
- No Recoil, Rapid Fire, Infinite Ammo... (same as the external variant, but only applies to local player this time)
